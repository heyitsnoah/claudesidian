# Permanent Notes

The core of your Zettelkasten - atomic, interconnected ideas.

## Purpose

Permanent notes are refined, standalone ideas that form your personal knowledge network.

## Characteristics

- **Atomic**: One idea per note
- **Self-contained**: Understandable without context
- **In your own words**: Fully processed and internalized
- **Linked**: Connected to other permanent notes
- **Evergreen**: Timeless, not tied to a specific moment

## Structure

```markdown
---
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [topic1, topic2]
---

# [Clear, descriptive title]

[A single, well-articulated idea in 1-3 paragraphs]

## Related

- [[Related Permanent Note 1]]
- [[Related Permanent Note 2]]

## Sources

- [[Literature Note that inspired this]]
```

## Writing Guidelines

1. **One idea only**: If you have multiple points, create multiple notes
2. **Write for your future self**: Be clear and complete
3. **Use your own words**: This ensures understanding
4. **Link generously**: Connections create value
5. **Explain the connection**: Don't just link - say why

## The Zettelkasten Workflow

```
Fleeting Note → Literature Note → Permanent Note

```
