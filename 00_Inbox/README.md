# ðŸ“¥ Inbox

Your capture zone for new ideas, quick thoughts, and unprocessed information.

## Purpose

The Inbox is a **temporary** holding area designed for:
- Quick capture without worrying about organization
- Daily notes and journaling
- Web clippings and interesting finds
- Meeting notes before processing
- Random thoughts and ideas

## How to Use

### Daily Workflow
1. **Capture first, organize later** - Don't slow down to categorize
2. **Use daily notes** - One note per day for stream of consciousness
3. **Dump links and quotes** - Save now, process later
4. **Don't let it pile up** - Process weekly

### Weekly Processing
Every week, review your inbox and:
- Move project-related notes to `01_Projects/`
- Move ongoing topics to `02_Areas/`
- Move reference material to `03_Resources/`
- Archive completed items to `04_Archive/`
- Delete what's no longer relevant

## Claude Code Commands

### Quick Capture
```
Create a new note in 00_Inbox called [title] 
with these thoughts: [content]
```

### Process Inbox
```
Review all notes in 00_Inbox.
Help me decide where each should go 
based on the PARA method.
```

### Find Connections
```
Look at recent notes in my inbox.
What patterns or themes do you see?
What existing notes might these connect to?
```

## Tips

- **Don't aim for perfection** - The inbox is meant to be messy
- **Use descriptive filenames** - Makes processing easier
- **Date your notes** - YYYY-MM-DD format helps with sorting
- **Link liberally** - Even to notes that don't exist yet
- **Review regularly** - Don't let items sit for more than 2 weeks

## File Naming

Suggested formats:
- Daily notes: `2024-03-15.md`
- Quick captures: `2024-03-15 - Meeting with Team.md`
- Web clips: `2024-03-15 - Article Title - Source.md`
- Ideas: `Idea - Brief Description.md`

Remember: The Inbox is where ideas begin, not where they live forever.
