For that is indeed what is challenged. I suspect we are, in the wider cultural context, finally beginning to appreciate this. Artists, writers, poets and playwrights have started to imbibe and deploy ideas from quantum physics: see, for instance, plays such as Tom Stoppard’s Hapgood and Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen, and novels such as Jeanette Winterson’s Gut Symmetries and Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveler’s Wife. We can argue about how accurately or aptly these writers appropriate the scientific ideas, but it is right that there should be imaginative responses to quantum mechanics, because it is quite possible that only an imagination sufficiently broad and liberated will come close to articulating what it is about.",

For them, the meaning mattered intensely. In 1998 the American physicist John Wheeler, a pioneer of modern quantum theory, lamented the loss of the ‘desperate puzzlement’ that was in the air in the 1930s. ‘I want to recapture that feeling for all, even if it is my last act on Earth’, Wheeler said.",

One of the opened boxes was always empty while the other contained a gem. How could that be? Surely chance alone should guarentee that someone would guess right some time? Finally the daughter, who was getting impatient to be wed, intervened by opening up the boxes for the rather dishy son of a prophet. But she didn’t open the two he’d predicted to be both full or both empty. Instead she opened one he’d guessed was filled, and one he’d guessed was empty. And both guesses proved correct. After some weak objection, the seer accepted that the suitor had made two correct guesses, and the daughter was married. The seer had foiled previous suitors because his boxes were quantum boxes, and he had entangled them to create correlations such that, if one opened box was filled, the other would be empty and vice versa. That made it impossible to satisfy the seer’s challenge and show you’d guessed right.

And this has nothing to do with observation in the normal sense: we don’t need a conscious mind to ‘look’ in order to ‘collapse the wavefunction’. All we need is for the environment to disperse the quantum coherence. This happens with extraordinary efficiency – it’s probably the most efficient process known to science. And it is very clear why size matters here: there is simply more interaction with the environment, and therefore faster decoherence, for larger objects.",

The signal could never be intercepted and read without the tampering being detected. This was the start of the technology known as quantum cryptography. The idea goes like this. Alice encodes her message in two entangled qubits – 1s and 0s represented by, say, the polarization states of pairs of photons. One photon from each entangled pair is then sent to Bob, who measures their states and so decodes the message.",

When we make a measurement, we really do get just one result out of the many that quantum mechanics offers. Wavefunction collapse seemed to be demanded in order to connect the theory to reality. So what Everett was saying was that this isn’t, after all, what reality is. It’s not quantum mechanics that is at fault, but our concept of reality. We only think that there’s a single outcome of a measurement. But in fact all of them occur. We only see one of those realities, but the others have a separate physical existence too.",
