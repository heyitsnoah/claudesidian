# De-AI-ify Text

Remove AI-generated patterns and restore natural human voice to your writing.

## Processing: $ARGUMENTS

I'll create a de-AI-ified version of your text that sounds more human and less machine-generated.

## What Gets Removed

### 1. Overused Transitions
- "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Nevertheless"
- Excessive "However" usage
- "While X, Y" openings

### 2. AI Clichés
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "Let's dive deep"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Harness the power of"

### 3. Hedging Language
- "It's important to note"
- "It's worth mentioning"
- Vague quantifiers: "various," "numerous," "myriad"

### 4. Corporate Buzzwords
- "utilize" → "use"
- "facilitate" → "help"
- "optimize" → "improve"
- "leverage" → "use"

### 5. Robotic Patterns
- Rhetorical questions followed by immediate answers
- Obsessive parallel structures
- Always using exactly three examples
- Announcement of emphasis

## What Gets Added

### Natural Voice
- Varied sentence lengths
- Conversational tone
- Direct statements
- Specific examples

### Human Rhythm
- Natural transitions
- Confident assertions
- Personal perspective
- Authentic phrasing

## Process

1. **Read original file**
2. **Create copy with "-HUMAN" suffix**
3. **Apply de-AI-ification**
4. **Provide change log**

## Output

You'll get:
- A new file with natural human voice
- Change log showing what was fixed
- List of places needing specific examples

## Example Transformations

**Before (AI):**
"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's crucial to understand that leveraging AI effectively isn't just about utilizing cutting-edge technology—it's about harnessing its transformative potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities."

**After (Human):**
"AI works best when you use it for specific tasks. Focus on what it does well: writing code, analyzing data, and answering questions."
