# Release Command

Automates the entire release process: analyzes recent commits to determine
version bump type, updates version in package.json, moves unreleased changelog
entries to the new version, commits everything, creates a git tag, and pushes to
GitHub.

## Task

1. Analyze recent commits since last tag to determine version bump type
2. Update version in package.json
3. Move "Unreleased" entries in CHANGELOG.md to the new version section
4. Commit the changes
5. Create an annotated git tag
6. Push commits and tags to GitHub

## Process

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Ensure on main/master branch
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Verify CHANGELOG.md and package.json exist
   - Get current version from package.json

2. **Determine Version Bump**
   - If argument provided (major/minor/patch), use that
   - Otherwise, analyze commits since last tag:
     - Look for "BREAKING CHANGE" or "!" = major bump
     - Look for "feat:" = minor bump
     - Look for "fix:", "docs:", "chore:" = patch bump
   - Calculate new version number

3. **Update Files**
   - Update version in package.json
   - Move "Unreleased" section in CHANGELOG.md to new version section
   - Add comparison links for the new version
   - Create new empty "Unreleased" section

4. **Git Operations**
   - Stage changes: `git add package.json CHANGELOG.md`
   - Commit: `git commit -m "chore: release v{version}"`
   - Create annotated tag: `git tag -a v{version} -m "Release v{version}"`
   - Push commits: `git push`
   - Push tags: `git push --tags`

5. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Use `gh release create` to publish the release automatically
   - Extract the version section from CHANGELOG.md for release notes
   - Include the "Generated with Claude Code" footer
   - This ensures the release is visible in GitHub's releases page

6. **Provide Confirmation**
   - Show the GitHub release URL
   - Confirm successful publication

## Version Bump Rules

### Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

**Quick Decision Guide:**

- Can users do something they couldn't do before? ‚Üí **MINOR**
- Did something that worked break? ‚Üí **MAJOR** (if breaking) or **PATCH** (if
  fixing)
- Did something that worked get better? ‚Üí **PATCH**

**MAJOR** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0):

- Breaking changes that require users to change their code/config
- Removing features or commands
- Changing command syntax or behavior incompatibly
- Commits with "BREAKING CHANGE" in body
- Commits with "!" after type (e.g., "feat!:")

**MINOR** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0):

- **NEW capabilities** added (not enhancements to existing features)
- Making something possible that wasn't possible before
- New commands, new tools, new integrations
- New optional features that don't affect existing functionality
- Significant architectural changes that enable new functionality
- Commits starting with "feat:" that add NEW functionality
- Examples:
  - Adding a new `/command`
  - Adding a new MCP server
  - Adding vault import capability (first time)
  - Making upgrade work without git connection (was impossible before)
  - Enabling a feature to work offline when it required internet before

**PATCH** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1):

- Bug fixes and minor improvements
- Enhancements to existing features (that already worked)
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Refactoring without changing behavior
- Commits with "fix:", "docs:", "style:", "refactor:", "perf:", "test:",
  "chore:"
- Examples:
  - Making an existing command smarter (but not enabling new use cases)
  - Improving error messages
  - Fixing bugs in existing features
  - Enhancing existing import to be more intelligent
  - Improving UI/formatting of existing features

### Commit Message Best Practices

**Use "feat:" only for NEW features:**

- ‚úÖ `feat: add vault import capability`
- ‚ùå `feat: enhance vault import` (should be `fix:` or `refactor:`)

**Use "fix:" for improvements and corrections:**

- ‚úÖ `fix: improve vault detection accuracy`
- ‚úÖ `fix: correct file counting in init-bootstrap`

**Use "refactor:" for code improvements:**

- ‚úÖ `refactor: enhance profile building with URL fetching`
- ‚úÖ `refactor: make init-bootstrap questions smarter`

**Use "perf:" for performance improvements:**

- ‚úÖ `perf: optimize vault analysis for large vaults`

## Example Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect version bump from commits
claude run release

# Force specific version bump
claude run release patch
claude run release minor
claude run release major

# Example output:
# üì¶ Current version: 0.1.0
# üîç Analyzing commits since last release...
#
# Found commits:
# - feat: add video support to Gemini Vision
# - docs: update README with setup instructions
# - fix: correct attachment link handling
#
# ‚ú® Detected version bump: MINOR (new features added)
# üìù New version: 0.2.0
#
# ‚úÖ Updated package.json
# ‚úÖ Updated CHANGELOG.md
# ‚úÖ Committed changes
# ‚úÖ Created tag v0.2.0
# ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
# ‚úÖ Created GitHub release
#
# üéâ Release v0.2.0 complete!
#
# GitHub Release: https://github.com/user/repo/releases/tag/v0.2.0
```

## Error Handling

- If not on main branch: "Please switch to main branch first"
- If uncommitted changes: "Please commit or stash changes first"
- If no changes since last release: "No changes to release"
- If version already exists: "Version X.X.X already exists"

## Safety Features

- Dry run mode: Show what would happen without making changes
- Confirmation prompt before pushing
- Validation of version format
- Check for existing tags before creating
