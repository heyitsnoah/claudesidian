# Initialize Bootstrap Configuration

This command helps you create a personalized CLAUDE.md configuration file by
asking questions about your Obsidian workflow and preferences.

## Task

Read the CLAUDE-BOOTSTRAP.md template and interactively gather information about
the user's:

- Existing vault structure (if any)
- Workflow preferences
- Note-taking style
- Organization methods
- Specific requirements

Then generate a customized CLAUDE.md file tailored to their needs.

## Process

1. **Initial Environment Setup**
   - Get current date with `date` command for timestamps
   - Check current folder name and ask if they want to rename it
   - If yes, guide them through renaming (handle parent directory move)
   - Check for package.json and install dependencies:
     - Try `pnpm install` first (faster, better)
     - Fall back to `npm install` if pnpm not available
   - Verify core dependencies are installed
   - Check git status:
     - If no .git folder: Initialize git repository
     - If has remote origin: Ask about development work
       - Personal vault: Remove origin and .github folder
       - Contributing: Keep origin and workflows intact
     - If clean local repo: Ready to go
   - Don't create folders yet - wait until after asking about organization
     method

2. **Check Existing Configuration**
   - Look for existing CLAUDE.md
   - If exists, ask if they want to update or start fresh
   - Check for CLAUDE-BOOTSTRAP.md template

3. **Gather Vault Information**
   - Search common locations for existing Obsidian vaults (.obsidian folder)
   - Check these paths with appropriate depth limits:
     - `~/Documents` (maxdepth 3) - all platforms
     - `~/Desktop` (maxdepth 3) - all platforms
     - `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents` (maxdepth 5 -
       **macOS only**, iCloud vaults)
     - Home directory `~/` (maxdepth 2) - all platforms
     - Current directory parent (maxdepth 2) - all platforms
   - If found, ask: "Found Obsidian vault at [path]. Is this the vault you want
     to import?"
   - Count files correctly: `find [path] -type f -name "*.md" | wc -l` (no depth
     limit)
   - Show vault size: `du -sh [path]`
   - If confirmed, analyze vault structure:
     - Run `tree -L 3 -d [path]` to see folder hierarchy
     - Sample 10-15 random notes to understand content types
     - List 30-50 recent file names to detect naming patterns
     - Check for daily notes folder and format
     - Identify most active folders by file count
     - Detect if using PARA, Zettelkasten, Johnny Decimal, or custom
   - If not the right one or none found:
     - **On macOS only:** Ask: "Is your vault stored in iCloud Drive? (yes/no)"
     - If yes (macOS): "Please enter the full path to your vault (e.g.,
       ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/YourVault)"
     - If no, or on Linux/Windows: "Please enter the path to your existing
       vault, or type 'skip' to start fresh"
     - **Validate user-provided paths** (see "User Path Validation" section
       below)
   - If no existing vault or user skips, they're starting fresh

4. **Ask Configuration Questions**
   - "What's your name?" (for personalization)
   - "Would you like me to research your public work to better understand your
     context?"
     - If yes: Search for information
     - ALWAYS show findings and ask "Is this correct?" for confirmation
     - If multiple people found, list them numbered for selection
     - If wrong person, offer to search again or skip
     - Save relevant context about their work, writing style, areas of expertise
   - "Do you follow the PARA method or have a different organization system?"
   - "What are your main use cases? (research, writing, project management,
     knowledge base, daily notes)"

   **If using PARA, ask specific setup questions:**
   [PARA Method by Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)
   - "What active projects are you working on?" (Create folders in 01_Projects)
   - "What areas of responsibility do you maintain?" (e.g., Work, Health,
     Finance, Family)
   - "What topics do you research frequently?" (Set up in 03_Resources)
   - "Any projects you recently completed?" (Can archive with summaries)

   **General preferences:**
   - Check .obsidian/community-plugins.json to see what plugins they use
   - Analyze existing files to detect naming convention automatically
   - Check for attachments folder to see if they work with media files
   - "Do you use git for version control?"
   - "Any specific websites or resources you reference often?"
   - "Do you have any specific writing style preferences?"
   - "Are there any workflows or patterns you want Claude to follow?"
   - "Would you like a weekly review ritual? (e.g., Thursday project review)"
   - "Do you prefer 'thinking mode' (questions/exploration) vs 'writing mode'?"

5. **Optional Tool Setup**

   **Gemini Vision (already included)**
   - Ask: "Gemini Vision is already included for analyzing images, PDFs, and
     videos. Would you like to activate it? (yes/no/later)"
   - Explain: "You just need a free API key from Google. This lets Claude
     analyze any visual content in your vault."
   - If later: "No problem! You can set it up anytime by running
     `/setup-gemini`"
   - If yes:
     - Guide to get API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey (free, takes
       30 seconds)
     - Help add to shell profile (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)
     - Run
       `claude mcp add --scope project gemini-vision node .claude/mcp-servers/gemini-vision.mjs`
     - Configure .mcp.json with API key
     - Test the connection with a sample command

   **Firecrawl (already included)**
   - Ask: "Firecrawl is included for web research. Would you like to set it up?
     (yes/no/later)"
   - Explain: "This is a game-changer for research! When you find an article or
     website, you can save it directly to your vault as markdown - preserving
     the content forever, making it searchable, and letting Claude analyze it.
     Perfect for building a research library."
   - Example: "Just tell Claude: 'Save this article to my vault: [URL]' and it's
     done!"
   - If later: "You can set it up anytime by running `/setup-firecrawl`"
   - If yes:
     - Guide to get API key from https://firecrawl.dev (free tier available)
     - Help configure the scripts in .scripts/
     - Show example usage: `.scripts/firecrawl-scrape.sh https://example.com`

6. **Generate Custom Configuration**
   - Get current date: `date +"%B %d, %Y"` for the CLAUDE.md header
   - Save preferences to `.claude/vault-config.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "user": {
         "name": "Jane Smith",
         "background": {
           "companies": ["Variance", "Percolate"],
           "roles": ["Co-founder", "Writer"],
           "publications": ["Why Is This Interesting?", "every.to"],
           "expertise": [
             "Developer tools",
             "Marketing tech",
             "Systems thinking"
           ],
           "interests": ["AI for thinking", "Note-taking systems", "Creativity"]
         },
         "profileSources": [
           "https://whyisthisinteresting.com/about",
           "https://every.to/@username"
         ],
         "customContext": "Focuses on AI as thinking augmentation, not just writing",
         "publicProfile": true
       },
       "vaultPath": "/path/to/existing/vault",
       "fileNamingPattern": "detected-pattern",
       "organizationMethod": "PARA",
       "primaryUses": ["research", "writing", "projects"],
       "tools": {
         "geminiVision": true,
         "firecrawl": false
       },
       "projects": ["Book - Productivity", "SaaS App"],
       "areas": ["Newsletter", "Health"],
       "importedAt": "2025-01-13",
       "lastUpdated": "2025-01-13"
     }
     ```
   - Start with CLAUDE-BOOTSTRAP.md as base
   - Add user-specific sections:
     - Custom folder structure with their actual projects/areas
     - Personal workflows
     - Preferred tools and scripts
     - Specific guidelines
     - MCP configuration if set up
   - Include their websites/resources if provided
   - Add any custom naming conventions
   - Pre-populate with their projects and areas:
     - Create project folders in 01_Projects/
     - Create area folders in 02_Areas/
     - Create resource topics in 03_Resources/
     - Add README files explaining each project/area

7. **Import Existing Vault (if applicable)**
   - If user has existing vault:
     - Create OLD_VAULT folder: `mkdir OLD_VAULT`
     - Copy entire vault preserving structure:
       `cp -r [vault-path]/* ./OLD_VAULT/`
     - Copy Obsidian configuration: `cp -r [vault-path]/.obsidian ./`
     - Check for and copy other important files:
       - `.trash/` (Obsidian's trash folder)
       - `.smart-connections/` (if using that plugin)
       - Any workspace files: `.obsidian.vimrc`, etc.
     - Skip copying: `.git/` (they'll have their own), `.claude/` (using ours)
     - Show summary: "Imported your vault to OLD_VAULT/ (X files, Y folders)"
     - Explain: "Your original structure is preserved in OLD_VAULT. You can
       gradually migrate files to the PARA folders as needed."

8. **Create Supporting Files**
   - Generate initial folder structure if new vault
   - Create README files for main folders
   - For each project folder, create subfolders:
     - Research/ (source materials)
     - Chats/ (AI conversations)
     - Daily Progress/ (running log)
   - Create 05_Attachments/Organized/ directory
   - Set up .gitignore if using git (include .mcp.json, node_modules)
   - Create initial templates if requested
   - Create WEEKLY_REVIEW.md if user wants review ritual
   - Remove FIRST_RUN marker file if it exists
   - Make initial git commit if repository was initialized

9. **Run Test Commands**
   - Execute `pnpm vault:stats` to verify scripts work

## Important Implementation Notes

### Handling Multiple Vaults

When multiple vaults are detected:

1. **Always list all vaults found** with clear numbering and details
2. **Require explicit selection** - don't assume which vault to use
3. **Confirm the selection** before proceeding with import
4. **Handle ambiguous responses** - if user provides unclear input (like pasting
   a screenshot), ask for clarification:
   - "I see you've shared a screenshot. Could you please type the number (1-3)
     of the vault you'd like to import?"
   - "I need a clear selection. Please type '1', '2', or '3' to choose a vault,
     or 'skip' to start fresh."

### Never Proceed Without Clear Confirmation

If the user's response is unclear:

- Don't guess or assume
- Ask for explicit confirmation
- Provide clear options again
- Example: "I want to make sure I import the right vault. Please type the number
  of your choice (1, 2, or 3)."

### Platform Compatibility

This command is designed to work across Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL/Git
Bash), with platform-specific features:

**All Platforms:**

- Search ~/Documents, ~/Desktop, home directory
- Standard Obsidian vault detection
- Full vault import and setup

**macOS Only:**

- iCloud Drive vault detection and import
- Obsidian's iCloud sync is macOS-only, so iCloud features are disabled on other
  platforms

**Platform Detection:**

```bash
# Check platform
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  # macOS - enable iCloud features
  PLATFORM="macOS"
  ICLOUD_SUPPORTED=true
elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu"* ]]; then
  # Linux
  PLATFORM="Linux"
  ICLOUD_SUPPORTED=false
elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "msys" || "$OSTYPE" == "cygwin" ]]; then
  # Windows (Git Bash or WSL)
  PLATFORM="Windows"
  ICLOUD_SUPPORTED=false
fi
```

### iCloud Vault Search Implementation

When searching for vaults, use this find command pattern:

```bash
# Standard locations (shallow search)
# Note: 2>/dev/null suppresses expected permission errors from system directories
# If no vaults are found, we'll ask the user for their vault path
find ~/Documents ~/Desktop -maxdepth 3 -type d -name ".obsidian" 2>/dev/null

# iCloud location (deeper search needed due to nested structure)
# Only search on macOS
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  find ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents -maxdepth 5 -type d -name ".obsidian" 2>/dev/null
fi

# Home directory (shallow to avoid deep recursion)
find ~ -maxdepth 2 -type d -name ".obsidian" 2>/dev/null
```

The iCloud path requires:

- Higher maxdepth (5) due to nested folder structure
- Escaped spaces in path name
- Silent error handling (2>/dev/null) as many users won't have iCloud
- Platform check (macOS only)

**Error Handling Note:** Permission errors are suppressed (2>/dev/null) because
they're expected when searching system directories. If no vaults are found, the
script gracefully prompts the user for their vault path.

### User Path Validation

When users manually provide a vault path, validate it thoroughly with helpful
error messages:

```bash
# User provided path
USER_PATH="$1"

# Expand tilde and resolve to absolute path
USER_PATH="${USER_PATH/#\~/$HOME}"
REAL_PATH=$(realpath "$USER_PATH" 2>/dev/null)

# Validation 1: Path exists
if [ -z "$REAL_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Path does not exist: $USER_PATH"
  echo ""
  echo "💡 Suggestions:"
  echo "   • Check for typos in the path"
  echo "   • Make sure you're using the full path (e.g., /Users/name/vault)"
  echo "   • You can use ~ for your home directory (e.g., ~/Documents/vault)"
  exit 1
fi

# Validation 2: Is a directory
if [ ! -d "$REAL_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Not a directory: $REAL_PATH"
  echo ""
  echo "💡 The path exists but points to a file, not a folder."
  exit 1
fi

# Validation 3: Contains .obsidian folder
if [ ! -d "$REAL_PATH/.obsidian" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Not a valid Obsidian vault (no .obsidian folder)"
  echo "   Looking in: $REAL_PATH"
  echo ""
  echo "💡 Suggestions:"
  echo "   • Make sure the path points to your vault root (not a subfolder)"
  echo "   • Check that you've opened this vault in Obsidian at least once"
  echo "   • Try the path without trailing slash"
  echo "   • For iCloud: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/YourVault"
  exit 1
fi

# Validation 4: Readable permissions
if [ ! -r "$REAL_PATH/.obsidian" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Cannot read vault directory (permission denied)"
  echo "   Path: $REAL_PATH"
  echo ""
  echo "💡 You may need to:"
  echo "   • Check file permissions with: ls -la \"$REAL_PATH\""
  echo "   • Make sure you own this directory"
  exit 1
fi

# Show resolved path if different from input
if [ "$USER_PATH" != "$REAL_PATH" ]; then
  echo "✓ Resolved path: $REAL_PATH"
fi

# Valid vault path
VAULT_PATH="$REAL_PATH"
echo "✓ Valid Obsidian vault found"
```

This validation:

- Expands `~` to home directory properly
- Resolves symlinks and relative paths to absolute paths
- Checks all essential requirements (exists, is directory, has .obsidian,
  readable)
- Provides helpful, actionable error messages with suggestions
- Shows the resolved path so users understand what's being checked
- Trusts users (allows symlinks, paths outside home directory)
- Cross-platform compatible (works on Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL)

### iCloud Sync State Checking

When a user selects an iCloud vault, check sync state and warn if needed:

```bash
# After user confirms vault selection
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]] && [[ "$vault_path" == *"iCloud"* ]]; then
  # Check for common iCloud sync indicators
  if [ -f "$vault_path/.icloud" ] || [ -f "$vault_path/.obsidian/.icloud" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "📱 iCloud Sync Notice:"
    echo "   This vault appears to be still downloading from iCloud."
    echo "   For best results, open it in Obsidian first to ensure files are synced."
    echo ""
    read -p "Continue anyway? (yes/no): " sync_answer
    if [[ ! "$sync_answer" =~ ^[Yy] ]]; then
      echo "No problem! Open the vault in Obsidian, then re-run /init-bootstrap"
      exit 0
    fi
  else
    echo ""
    echo "📱 iCloud vault detected. If import seems incomplete, make sure sync is complete."
    echo ""
  fi
fi
```

This provides a soft warning that:

- Only runs on macOS for iCloud paths
- Checks for placeholder files that indicate incomplete download
- Asks for confirmation if sync issues detected
- Gives gentle reminder even when no issues found
- Lets users proceed if they choose

## Interactive Example

````
User: claude run init-bootstrap
Assistant: Welcome! I'll help you set up your personalized Obsidian + Claude configuration.

📅 Today's date: [Gets from `date +"%B %d, %Y"`]

First, let me check your setup...

📁 **Folder Name Check**
Current folder: claudesidian
Would you like to rename this folder to something more personal? (e.g., my-vault, knowledge-base, obsidian-notes)
*Why: Your vault should have a name that makes sense to you - you'll see it every day!*

[If yes: Handles the rename by moving to parent directory and back]

Now setting up your environment...

📦 **Installing Dependencies**
[Checks for pnpm, uses npm if not available]
[Installs dependencies with pnpm/npm]
*Why: These tools enable Claude Code to work with your vault effectively*

🔓 **Repository Setup**

**Will you be contributing to claudesidian development?**
- **No** (Personal vault only) → I'll remove GitHub workflows and disconnect from the repo
- **Yes** (I want to contribute) → I'll keep the development setup intact

[Implementation:]
```bash
# If user says "No" (personal vault):
rm -rf .github  # Remove GitHub workflows
git remote remove origin  # Disconnect from claudesidian repo

# If user says "Yes" (contributing):
# Keep .github folder and origin remote
echo "Development setup preserved for contributing"
````

_Why: Personal vaults don't need GitHub Actions, but contributors benefit from
the automation_

📂 **Creating Folder Structure** [Creates folders based on your chosen
organization method] _Why: A good structure helps you organize and find your
knowledge effectively_

🎯 **Finalizing Setup** [Checks git status and removes first-run marker] _Why:
Git gives you version control, and removing the marker ensures you won't see the
welcome message again_

✅ Folder renamed (if requested) ✅ Dependencies installed ✅ Core folders
created ✅ Git repository ready (disconnected from original claudesidian) ✅
First-run marker removed

Now let me ask you a few questions to customize your setup:

🔍 **Searching for existing Obsidian vaults...** [Searches ~/Documents,
~/Desktop, home directory, and parent directories. On macOS, also searches
iCloud Drive]

### Case 1: Single Vault Found

Found Obsidian vault at: ~/Documents/MyNotes 📊 Vault stats: 2,517 markdown
files, 1.1GB total size Would you like to import this vault?

- **yes** - Import this vault
- **no** - Search for a different vault
- **skip** - Start fresh without importing
- **path** - Specify a different path manually

User: yes

### Case 2: Multiple Vaults Found

🔍 **Found multiple Obsidian vaults:**

1. **~/Documents/MyNotes** (2,517 files, 1.1GB)
   - Last modified: 2 hours ago
   - Contains: Daily notes, projects, resources

2. **~/Desktop/WorkVault** (892 files, 450MB)
   - Last modified: 3 days ago
   - Contains: Client projects, meeting notes

3. **~/Documents/ObsidianVault** (156 files, 23MB)
   - Last modified: 2 weeks ago
   - Contains: Personal notes, drafts

**Which vault would you like to import?**

- Enter **1-3** to select a vault
- **all** - Import all vaults (each to a separate folder)
- **skip** - Start fresh without importing
- **path** - Specify a different path manually

User: 1

**Confirming your selection:** You selected: ~/Documents/MyNotes (2,517 files,
1.1GB)

Is this correct? (yes/no)

User: yes

Great! I'll import your vault to OLD_VAULT/ where it will be safely preserved.
You can migrate files to the PARA folders at your own pace.

### Case 3: No Vaults Found (Platform-Aware)

🔍 **No Obsidian vaults found in common locations.**

**On macOS:** Is your vault stored in iCloud Drive? (yes/no)

User: yes

Please enter the full path to your vault: (Example: ~/Library/Mobile
Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/YourVault)

User: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/MyVault

[Validates path and shows vault stats]

Found vault at: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/MyVault
📊 Vault stats: 1,248 markdown files, 523MB total size

Would you like to import this vault? (yes/skip)

**On Linux/Windows:** Please enter the path to your existing Obsidian vault, or
type 'skip' to start fresh: (Example: ~/Documents/MyVault or
/home/user/obsidian-vault)

User: ~/Documents/MyVault

[Validates path and shows vault stats]

Found vault at: ~/Documents/MyVault 📊 Vault stats: 1,248 markdown files, 523MB
total size

Would you like to import this vault? (yes/skip)

📦 **Analyzing your vault structure...** [Running tree to see folder hierarchy]
[Sampling notes to understand content] [Detecting naming patterns from recent
files]

I can see you're using:

- A modified PARA structure with custom folders
- Date-prefixed files for daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Project folders with nested research
- Heavy use of the Resources folder for reference material

📦 **Importing your vault...** [Copying files to OLD_VAULT/] [Preserving
.obsidian settings] [Checking for plugin folders]

✅ Imported 2,517 files (1.1GB) to OLD_VAULT/ Your original structure is
completely preserved!

Got it! I'll remember that you focus on AI as a thinking tool, not just a
writing assistant.
