# Reference

Non-actionable reference materials.

## What Goes Here

- Documentation and guides
- Checklists and procedures
- Contact information
- Policies and standards
- Any information you need to reference but don't need to act on

## Organization

Organize by topic or area. Use subfolders as needed:

```
02_Reference/
├── Procedures/
├── Contacts/
├── Standards/
└── [Your categories]
```

## Tips

- Reference material is **not actionable**
- If it requires action, it goes in Actions or Projects
- Review periodically to remove outdated information
- Link from projects and actions as needed
