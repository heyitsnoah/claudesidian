## Quick Start

1. Start at [[_GTD]] dashboard
2. Capture items to [[00_Actions/Inbox]]
3. Process inbox daily
4. Work from [[00_Actions/Next]] actions
5. Weekly review to stay current

## The GTD Workflow

```
Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage
```

1. **Capture**: Get everything into Inbox
2. **Clarify**: Is it actionable? What's the next action?
3. **Organize**: Put in the right list/project
4. **Reflect**: Daily and weekly reviews
5. **Engage**: Do with confidence

## Key Principles

- Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them
- Everything captured in a trusted system
- Next actions are single, physical steps
- Projects are outcomes requiring 2+ actions
- Regular reviews keep the system trusted
