## Processing Rules

When processing inbox items, ask:
1. **Is it actionable?**
   - No → Reference, Someday, or Delete
   - Yes → What's the next action?

2. **If actionable:**
   - < 2 minutes → Do it now
   - Delegate → Add to Waiting For
   - Defer → Add to Next Actions or Calendar

3. **If multi-step:**
   - Create a project in `01_Projects/`
   - Define the next action
