## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Include key concepts in name
- Avoid dates (unless historical)
- Use consistent formatting

### Note Structure
```markdown
# Concept Name

## Summary
One paragraph overview

## Key Points

- Main idea 2
- Main idea 3

## Connections

```

### Maintenance
- Review and update regularly
- Merge duplicate concepts
- Strengthen connections
- Delete what's no longer relevant

## Tips

- **Quality over quantity** - Better to deeply understand few concepts
- **Your words matter** - Rewrite in your own understanding
- **Links are gold** - Connections create value
- **Review regularly** - Unused knowledge fades
- **Share freely** - Teaching solidifies understanding

## Remember

Resources are your external brain. The value isn't in collecting, but in connecting and creating. Use Claude Code to help you see patterns and build understanding across your entire knowledge base.
