# My Life with the Saints (10th Anniversary Edition)


## Highlights

As C. S. Lewis writes in Mere Christianity: “How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerors have been: how gloriously different are the saints.”

The best way to come to know St. Thomas More, I believe, is to watch A Man for All Seasons.

Enter the idea of studying business. At the time, I had a vague idea that a business major would enable me to land a job in the “business end” of any number of fields, such as the “business end” of English (publishing) or the “business end” of art (managing a museum or gallery). At the very least, a business degree would likely lead to a high-paying job after graduation, and this, I reasoned, would make me happy. On this point, everyone—my family, my friends, my high school guidance counselor—agreed. The problem was that whenever I considered “earning a living,” I thought mostly about the “earning” and nothing about the “living.”

Wharton’s reputation in the corporate world made finding a job ridiculously easy. At the beginning of senior year, hundreds of corporate recruiters flocked to the school to conduct interviews: in a few months I had received a number of excellent offers. After narrowing them down to three or four, I settled on a corporate training program at General Electric in New York City. Once again, almost no reflection was involved in my decision. To use some accounting terminology, I simply went along with “generally accepted principles.” For example, what should you do at the end of business school? Interview for jobs. Which job offer should you accept? The one with the highest salary. The more important questions were the ones that no one asked me, or rather, that I failed to ask myself: What do you desire in life? And what does God desire for you?

I looked down at the bright green grass and thought about Merton’s strange, complicated, and contradictory life. And about my favorite lines from Walt Whitman, which come near the end of “Song of Myself”: I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love. If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.

the vanities of the world,” particularly concerning his physical appearance. He seems also to have been a ladies’ man. At least that’s how he fancied himself. He was definitely a rake. It was rumored that he fathered an illegitimate child. (There is some evidence to support this, but it is inconclusive.) And he may be the only canonized saint with a notarized police record, for nighttime brawling with intent to inflict serious harm.

In Paris he also completed what later become known as The Spiritual Exercises, a handbook of practices on prayer, on the human condition, on God’s love, and on the life of Jesus, all designed to help people draw closer to God. Iñigo also led his new roommate, Francisco Javier, through these exercises. His friend would later become better known, of course, as St. Francis Xavier, one of the Church’s great missionaries.
