# Been Wrong So Long It Feels Like Right: A King Oliver Novel


## Highlights

“You know how you said that me and my friends were different?” “Yeah?” “And how I said that we were mostly the same as everybody else?” “Uh-huh.” “The only real difference is that we believe that we can create our own reality; hunting the hunters, expecting a woman to be able to match most men in combat, blow for blow.” - loc: [1,393](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B0D3DS677F&amp;location&#x3D;1393)
