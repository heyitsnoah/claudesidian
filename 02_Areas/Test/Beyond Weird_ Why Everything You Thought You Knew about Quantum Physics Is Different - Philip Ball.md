# Beyond Weird: Why Everything You Thought You Knew about Quantum Physics Is Different


## Highlights

Rather than insisting on its difficulty, we might better regard it as a beguiling, maddening, even amusing gauntlet thrown down to challenge the imagination. For that is indeed what is challenged. I suspect we are, in the wider cultural context, finally beginning to appreciate this. Artists, writers, poets and playwrights have started to imbibe and deploy ideas from quantum physics: see, for instance, plays such as Tom Stoppard’s Hapgood and Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen, and novels such as Jeanette Winterson’s Gut Symmetries and Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveler’s Wife. We can argue about how accurately or aptly these writers appropriate the scientific ideas, but it is right that there should be imaginative responses to quantum mechanics, because it is quite possible that only an imagination sufficiently broad and liberated will come close to articulating what it is about. - loc: [102](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;102)

Feynman seemed to feel that it was impossible and even pointless to attempt anything comparable for quantum mechanics: We can’t pretend to understand it since it affronts all our commonsense notions. The best we can do is to describe what happens in mathematics, in equations, and that’s very difficult. What is even harder is trying to decide what the equations mean. That’s the hardest thing of all. - loc: [143](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;143)

only a few decades ago, professing a serious interest in the topic could be tantamount to career suicide for a young physicist. Only a handful of scientists and philosophers, idiosyncratically if not plain crankily, insisted on caring about the answer. Many researchers would shrug or roll their eyes when the ‘meaning’ of quantum mechanics came up; some still do. ‘Ah, nobody understands it anyway!’ How different this is from the attitude of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and their contemporaries, for whom grappling with the apparent oddness of the theory became almost an obsession. For them, the meaning mattered intensely. In 1998 the American physicist John Wheeler, a pioneer of modern quantum theory, lamented the loss of the ‘desperate puzzlement’ that was in the air in the 1930s. ‘I want to recapture that feeling for all, even if it is my last act on Earth’, Wheeler said. - loc: [153](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;153)

***Note:*** "desperate puzzlement"

You can see that I’m already struggling to find a language that works for talking about these things. That’s OK, and you’ll have to get used to it. That’s how it should be. When words come too easily, it’s because we haven’t delved deeply enough (you’ll see that scientists can be guilty of that too). - loc: [191](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;191)

***Note:*** I've been thinkibg lately about if (really how) the human need for language inhibits our ability to understand things. If your mother tongue does not have the words for something then how much harder is it to understand? What is the instance of bilingualism among Nobel-winning scientists?

---
and there are plenty of accessible books on the subject.*2 - loc: [208](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;208)

Best of all for its narrative value is the largely good-natured but trenchant dispute that rumbled on for decades between Einstein and Bohr about what it all meant – about the nature of reality. This is indeed a superb story, and if you haven’t heard it before then you should.*1 - loc: [256](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;256)

The best illustration I know of that quantization is rather incidental to quantum theory is found in the book Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum, based on a series of lectures that Leonard Susskind, a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University, gave to undergraduates, which were written up with the help of the writer Art Friedman. The book is described as being ‘for anyone who ever regretted not taking physics at university, who knows a little but would like to know more’. - loc: [337](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;337)

***Note:*** I'm less than 10% into this book and already have 3 more to read!

Quantum objects are what they are, and we have no reason to suppose that ‘what they are’ changes in any meaningful way depending on how we try to look at them. Rather, all we can say is that what we measure sometimes looks like what we would expect to see if we were measuring discrete little ball-like entities, while in other experiments it looks like the behaviour expected of waves of the same kind as those of sound travelling in air, or that wrinkle and swell on the sea surface. So the phrase ‘wave–particle duality’ doesn’t really refer to quantum objects at all, but to the interpretation of experiments – which is to say, to our human-scale view of things. - loc: [392](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;392)


---
What makes the quantum situation of radioactive decay any different from this classical (and, forgive me, rather unfortunate) analogy of childbirth? We have every reason to suppose that, if we were able to monitor the biology of each pregnant mother and baby sufficiently closely, we could understand exactly why the respective birth process started when it did – perhaps some hormonal threshold was reached, say. But for radioactive decay, there is nothing you can monitor to explain why a particular atom decayed when it did. There is nothing we can call a reason. - loc: [606](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;606)

***Note:*** At this point in knowledge, sure. But there has to be an explanation, a trigger. We can't just live in a world where things happen with no cause. If that was the case, then what is the source of the wave function?

---
So, said Bohr, we had better just stop there. As he put it: There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature. - loc: [777](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;777)


---
At face value that sounds crazy. Why make a mathematical theory like quantum mechanics if you don’t think it can tell you about the system it is supposed to describe? But Bohr argued that quantum theory tells you something more meaningful – indeed, the only thing that can be meaningful. It tells you what you will find when you try to investigate that system. It tells you about measurements. - loc: [783](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;783)


---
the early days of this new physics, the problem was often debated in terms of the ‘role of the observer’. That the observer had a role at all was deeply troubling, because it seemed to challenge the very concept of science. If what we see depends on what questions we ask, whither then the idea of an objective world, governed by rules that pertain independently of our attempts to figure them out? As Heisenberg put it, science had ceased to be a way of peeking unnoticed at the world, and instead had become ‘an actor in [the] interplay between man and nature’. - loc: [813](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;813)

***Note:*** Like how what we get from an LLM depends on not just what questions we ask it but how.

---
But measurement does something else. It ‘collapses’ (Heisenberg’s original word was ‘reduces’) those possibilities, expressed in the wavefunction, to just one. Suppose that, before the measurement, the probabilities of finding some property of a quantum object with the values corresponding to states A, B and C are 10%, 70% and 20% respectively. When we make a single measurement on the object, we might find that we get the result C. What happened to A and B? We are forced to assert that the probabilities have now changed: that for C it is 100%, and for A and B it is zero. What’s more, we can’t get A and B back: if we repeat the measurement, we’ll keep getting C.*2 - loc: [1,043](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1043)

***Note:*** We will keep getting C *unless and until* we reset the quantum object in its original state. How in tge world does that happen??

---
To Bohr, wavefunction collapse was virtually emblematic of the distinction between the unitary quantum world and the everyday reality in which we make observations and measurements. Measurements must be classical by definition: they require some big apparatus with which humans can interact. From our perspective the world is made up of phenomena – things happen – and a phenomenon only exists when it has been measured. Wavefunction collapse is simply a name we give to the process by which we turn quantum states into observed phenomena. Wavefunction collapse is then a generator of knowledge: it is not so much a process that gives us the answers, but is the process by which answers are created. The outcome of that process can’t, in general, be predicted with certainty, but quantum mechanics gives us a method for calculating the probabilities of particular outcomes. That’s all we can ask for. - loc: [1,062](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1062)


---
Bohr could be stubborn and dogmatic as well as rather cryptic. But he deserves praise for defining the limits of what can be said with confidence. Some suspect that his intuition surpassed anything he could justify mathematically, or indeed semantically. As von Weizsäcker said, ‘Bohr was essentially right but he did not know why.’ - loc: [1,110](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1110)


---
But nevertheless the notion of a universal wavefunction is popular with cosmologists, for the perfectly valid reason that in the earliest moments of the Big Bang the entire universe was smaller than an atom and surely needs to be considered, in that moment, a quantum-mechanical entity. - loc: [1,222](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1222)

***Note:*** Should we just accept that as fact?

---
Quantum mechanics generally assumes that quantum states exist in some meaningful sense, and that the math tells us what we can know about those states. But in QBism there are no objective states. Rather, according to Chris Fuchs, ‘quantum states represent observers’ personal information, expectations and degrees of belief’. This view, he says, ‘allows one to see all quantum measurement events as little “moments of creation”, rather than as revealing anything pre-existent’. - loc: [1,303](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1303)

***Note:*** What if every time we collapse a wave function we are setting off a big bang in another universe?

---
The main thing you need to know about entanglement is this: it tells us that a quantum object may have properties that are not entirely located on that object. - loc: [1,704](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1704)


---
But this locality is just what quantum entanglement undermines – which is why ‘spooky action at a distance’ is precisely the wrong way to look at it. We can’t regard particle A and particle B in the EPR experiment as separate entities, even though they are separated in space. As far as quantum mechanics is concerned, entanglement makes them both parts of a single object. Or to put it another way, the spin of particle A is not located solely on A in the way that the redness of a cricket ball is located on the cricket ball. In quantum mechanics, properties can be non-local. - loc: [1,931](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1931)


---
What in fact we’re dealing with here is another kind of quantum superposition. We’ve seen that superposition refers to a situation in which a measurement on a quantum object could produce two or more possible outcomes, but we don’t know which it will be, only their relative probabilities. Entanglement is that same idea applied to two or more particles: a superposition of the state in which particle A has spin up and B spin down, say, and the state with the opposite configuration. Although the particles are separated, they must be described by a single wavefunction. We can’t untangle that wavefunction into some combination of two single-particle wavefunctions. - loc: [1,936](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;1936)

***Note:*** If we could change the spin of an entangled particle, would that change the spin of the second particle or would in disentangle the particles? Can you even disentangle particles? Can you have an entangled triad of particles?

---
Kochen and Specker pointed out that the outcomes of quantum measurements may depend on their context. This means something subtly different from the fact that different types of experiment on what seems like the same system (a double-slit experiment with or without a ‘path detector’, say) give different results. It means that if you look at a quantum object through different windows, you see different things. If you want to count the number of black and white balls in a jar, it doesn’t matter if you count the black ones or the white ones first, or if you tot them up in rows of five, or if you separate the two colours into piles and weigh them. You’ll get the same answer. But in quantum mechanics, even when you ask the same question (‘How many black and white balls are there?’), the answer you get may depend on how the measurement is done. - loc: [2,009](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2009)

***Note:*** Here is this similarity to interfacing with LLMs again

---
The Kochen–Specker theorem stipulates what follows from this dependence on context. In effect it is another corollary of the way that, in quantum mechanics, what we choose not to measure may leave an imprint on what we do measure. - loc: [2,018](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2018)

An Assyrian seer, unwilling to let his young daughter be wed to suitors who he considered unworthy, set them a task. He presented them with three closed boxes in a row, each of which might or might not have a gem inside it. Any prediction will identify at least two boxes that are guessed to be both empty, or two that are both filled. (Think about it for a moment and you’ll see that this must be so.) The suitors were asked to open those two, and if they were right then they would have the daughter’s hand. But they were never right! One of the opened boxes was always empty while the other contained a gem. How could that be? Surely chance alone should guarentee that someone would guess right some time? Finally the daughter, who was getting impatient to be wed, intervened by opening up the boxes for the rather dishy son of a prophet. But she didn’t open the two he’d predicted to be both full or both empty. Instead she opened one he’d guessed was filled, and one he’d guessed was empty. And both guesses proved correct. After some weak objection, the seer accepted that the suitor had made two correct guesses, and the daughter was married. The seer had foiled previous suitors because his boxes were quantum boxes, and he had entangled them to create correlations such that, if one opened box was filled, the other would be empty and vice versa. That made it impossible to satisfy the seer’s challenge and show you’d guessed right. But the daughter was able to reveal a correct guess by interrogating the same system with a different set of measurements. And that is what quantum contextuality is like.* - loc: [2,021](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2021)

You can’t say, to make a macroscopic analogy, ‘the ball is red’, but only ‘the ball is red when looked at through the round window’. It really is red under these conditions (to the extent that we can ever say how something really is). But equally, it really is green through the square window. Yes, but what colour is it really? According to Kochen and Specker, you can’t improve on the answer I’ve just given.* - loc: [2,043](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2043)

***Note:*** Is this possible to create as an art piece?

---
It is this waviness that gives rise to distinctly quantum phenomena like interference, superposition and entanglement. These behaviours become possible when there is a well-defined relationship between the quantum ‘waves’: in effect, when they are in step. This co-ordination is called coherence. - loc: [2,129](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2129)

***Note:*** coherence is a well-defined relationship between wave functions of 2 quantum objects

---
if the quantum wavefunctions of two states are not coherent, they cannot interfere, nor can they maintain a superposition. A loss of coherence (decoherence) therefore destroys these fundamentally quantum properties, and the states behave more like distinct classical systems. - loc: [2,134](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2134)


---
Quantum coherence is essentially what permits ‘quantumness’. - loc: [2,140](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2140)


---
There is no reason (that we yet know of) why in principle objects cannot remain in coherent quantum states no matter how big they are – provided that no measurement is made on them. But it seems that measurement somehow does destroy quantum coherence, forcing us to speak of the wavefunction as having ‘collapsed’. If we can understand how measurement unravels coherence then we would be able to bring measurement itself within the scope of quantum theory, rather than making it a boundary where the theory stops. - loc: [2,141](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2141)

***Note:*** Measurement of quantum activity == Tower of Babel. Arrogance of Man, smited.

---
The truth is that they don’t. Quantum superpositions of states aren’t fragile. On the contrary, they are highly contagious and apt to spread out rapidly. And that is what seems to destroy them. If a quantum system in a superposed state interacts with another particle, the two become linked into a composite superposition. That, we saw earlier, is exactly what entanglement is: a superposed state of two particles, whose interaction has turned them into a single quantum entity. - loc: [2,159](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2159)


---
In theory there is no end to this process. That entangled air molecule hits another, and the second molecule gets captured in an entangled state too. As time passes, the initial quantum system becomes more and more entangled with its environment. In effect, we then no longer have a well-defined quantum system embedded in an environment. Rather, system and environment have merged into a single superposition. - loc: [2,166](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2166)


---
Decoherence is what destroys the possibility of observing macroscopic superpositions – including Schrödinger’s live/dead cat. And this has nothing to do with observation in the normal sense: we don’t need a conscious mind to ‘look’ in order to ‘collapse the wavefunction’. All we need is for the environment to disperse the quantum coherence. This happens with extraordinary efficiency – it’s probably the most efficient process known to science. And it is very clear why size matters here: there is simply more interaction with the environment, and therefore faster decoherence, for larger objects. - loc: [2,218](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2218)


---
Here, then, is a concrete way to look at that most puzzling of quantum mysteries, which is that what we measure depends on how we look – on the context of the measurement. - loc: [2,412](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2412)


---
Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard pointed out in the early 1980s that quantum correlations between entangled states can be exploited to send information encoded in qubits that is immune to eavesdropping. The signal could never be intercepted and read without the tampering being detected. This was the start of the technology known as quantum cryptography. The idea goes like this. Alice encodes her message in two entangled qubits – 1s and 0s represented by, say, the polarization states of pairs of photons. One photon from each entangled pair is then sent to Bob, who measures their states and so decodes the message. - loc: [2,817](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2817)


---
I’ll say it upfront: no one fully understands how quantum computers work. - loc: [2,872](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2872)

***Note:*** Thank God!

---
But Bohr and colleagues didn’t bring wavefunction collapse into the picture just to make things difficult. They did it because that’s what seems to happen. When we make a measurement, we really do get just one result out of the many that quantum mechanics offers. Wavefunction collapse seemed to be demanded in order to connect the theory to reality. So what Everett was saying was that this isn’t, after all, what reality is. It’s not quantum mechanics that is at fault, but our concept of reality. We only think that there’s a single outcome of a measurement. But in fact all of them occur. We only see one of those realities, but the others have a separate physical existence too. - loc: [2,989](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;2989)

***Note:*** If MWI is true then how do we deal with the law of conservation of matter? is anything other than possibilities "lost" when the wave function collapses?

---
The issue is whether, like Bohr, you believe that quantum mechanics provides a prescription for evaluating the possible outcomes we might observe when we look at the quantum world, or whether you regard the Schrödinger equation as an inviolable and universal law that describes – in some sense is – reality. - loc: [3,154](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;3154)

Can it be right that the laws of Newtonian mechanics for our classical world, expressed in concise, prosaic words and sentences, must give way to something with the forbidding, abstract mathematical complexity of the quantum axioms? Or is this just because we don’t quite know what we’re talking about? When someone explains something in a complicated way, it’s often a sign that they don’t really understand it. - loc: [3,334](kindle://book?action&#x3D;open&amp;asin&#x3D;B07H9HNDYL&amp;location&#x3D;3334)
