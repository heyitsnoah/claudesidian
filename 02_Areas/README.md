```

## Area vs Project

**Ask yourself**: Does this have an end date?

| Area (Ongoing) | Project (Time-bound) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Health" | "Lose 10 pounds by June" |
| "Finances" | "Create 2024 budget" |
| "Writing" | "Finish blog post series" |
| "Learning" | "Complete Python course" |
| "Clients" | "Deliver Project X" |

## Maintenance Practices

### Weekly

- Update resource lists
- Clean up old notes

### Quarterly
- Deep review with Claude Code
- Adjust focus areas
- Archive outdated material

## Claude Code Prompts

### Health Check
```
Do a health check on all my areas.
Which have recent activity?
Which have been neglected?
```

### Balance Assessment
```
Looking at my areas, where am I spending most energy?
What's out of balance?
```

### Integration Opportunities
```
Find connections between my different areas.
Where could better integration create value?
```

## Tips

- **Areas inform Projects** - Projects often emerge from area needs
- **Keep them active** - Dead areas should be archived
- **Review regularly** - Areas drift without attention
- **Document standards** - What does "good" look like?
- **Track metrics** - Even qualitative areas benefit from measurement

## Remember

Areas are the backdrop of your life. They don't complete, but they evolve. Use Claude Code to help you see patterns and maintain balance across all your responsibilities.
