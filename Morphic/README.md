# Morphic Programming

Research and notes on Morphic programming paradigm.

## Overview

Morphic is a direct-manipulation user interface framework that first appeared in Self (programming language) and was later adopted by Squeak/Smalltalk and other systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Morphs**: The basic graphical objects
- **Direct manipulation**: Grab and modify objects directly
- **Liveness**: Changes are immediately visible
- **Composition**: Complex UIs from simple morphs
- **Self-describing**: Objects know how to display themselves

## Topics to Explore

- Morphic architecture and design principles
- Self programming language and Morphic origins
- Squeak/Smalltalk implementation
- Lively Kernel and web-based Morphic
- Modern applications and frameworks
- Comparison with other UI paradigms

## Folder Structure

Consider organizing by:
