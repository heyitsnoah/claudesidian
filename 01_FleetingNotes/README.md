# Fleeting Notes

Quick captures of ideas, thoughts, and observations.

## Purpose

Fleeting notes are temporary, raw captures - the first step in the Zettelkasten workflow.

## Characteristics

- **Quick and unpolished**: Don't spend time formatting
- **Capture immediately**: Write down ideas as they occur
- **Temporary**: Process within 1-2 days
- **Brief**: A few sentences to a paragraph

## Examples

- A sudden insight while reading
- A question that pops into your mind
- A connection you notice between ideas
- A quote you want to remember
- An observation from daily life

## Processing

1. Review fleeting notes daily
2. Expand promising ideas into Literature Notes or Permanent Notes
3. Delete notes that no longer seem valuable
4. Link to related permanent notes if applicable

## Tips

- Use a consistent quick-capture format
- Date your fleeting notes
- Don't overthink - capture first, process later
- Keep your phone/notebook handy for captures
